# Deferential_Drive_Mobile_Robot

This is a hybrid, low-level control software written for a differential-drive mobile robot, in order to drive the robot to a single goal position located approximately 1-2 meters away from it. In addition, the robot avoids curved obstacles by tracing around their boundary. 
The system uses dead-reckoning for odometry which is obtained from the infrared sensors attached to the robot's wheels. 5 sonar sensors located on the robot's bumper are used to detect and trace the obstacles located about 30cm away from the robot.


Hardware used:\
Arduino Uno\
2 Servomotors\
5 Sonar sensors\
8 rechargeable batteries\
